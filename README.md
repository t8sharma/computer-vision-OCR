# AI-Powered OCR

This is an AI-powered Optical Character Recognition (OCR) web application built using Flask, OpenCV, and Tesseract. The web app allows users to upload images and extract the text from those images using OCR. The extracted text is then displayed on the web page and can be downloaded as a `.txt` file.

## Features

- Upload image files and extract text using Tesseract OCR.
- Beautiful, modern AI-themed interface with glowing effects.
- Supports downloading extracted text as a `.txt` file.
- Responsive design for use on mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Python web framework used for handling server-side logic.
- **Tesseract OCR**: Open-source OCR engine for text extraction from images.
- **OpenCV**: Library used for image preprocessing to enhance OCR accuracy.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Frontend technologies to build the AI-themed interface.

## Prerequisites

To run this application, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

- **Python 3.10**
- **pip**: Python package manager.
- **Tesseract OCR**: [Download Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) and ensure it is installed and added to your system's PATH.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-ocr-app.git
